### Hey, Heads up!
This branch is no longer maintained but is still working. Why? Because it's based on a package from Google that covers the entire API (https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client).
Please use the latest version of the module on NPM (https://npmjs.com/yt-livechat) if you want something more powerful and lighter. 

# YouTube LiveChat
Event-based library to interact with any YouTube Live Chat.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install yt-livechat --save
```

## Usage
An full example is available in the branch. 

## History
- 1.0.0 First release
And then, end of the story :(
